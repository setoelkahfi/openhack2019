# VidyaVision
The vidyavision project is an open source project created for EWB in Openhack session by the team VidyaVision.

To use this bot you need python installed and the server with the QA system needs to be up and running. 
The current version of this project is integrated with Slack. (The current workspace VidyaVision in the #General channel.)
 OBS: Currently slack has taken down the temporary webhook used in demo code since it was public, making a new webhook (private) would maybe solve the problem. 
It also have a mockfile for sending the text message from a mobile phone to the bot.

To run the script type in a command window at the directory where you have the files:
python bot.py

Installment requirements: 


 rerequests, time, datetime, random
